# MariaDB + JSON

This repository contains sample code for working with [MariaDB](https://mariadb.com) and [JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)](https://www.json.org/json-en.html).

More specifically, this repository provides examples of [MariaDB JSON Function](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/json-functions/) usage.  

The content provided within this repository was demonstrated live during the MariaDB webinar, [Hybrid Data Model Best Practice: JSON + Relational](https://go.mariadb.com/21Q3-WBN-GLBL-OSSG-JSON-Hybrid-Data-Models-2021-06-15_Registration-LP.html?_ga=2.10936116.147413038.1623592041-1325804051.1609963010&_gac=1.248886645.1623452563.Cj0KCQjwk4yGBhDQARIsACGfAevWgi9zK2F3vjeZiYG6E-UPJRdRezA4P9CmugDX5SY0Cx72qbuDMWsaAtxMEALw_wcB).

## Contents

* [locations.sql](demos/locations.sql) - A simple collection of SQL statements that demonstrate various JSON functions that are available within MariaDB.
* [into_to_json.pptx](presentations/intro_to_json.pptx) - An slide presentation that introduces the fundamentals of using JSON with MariaDB.

    **Note:** The demo SQL scripts are meant to be executed step-by-step, not all at once.
